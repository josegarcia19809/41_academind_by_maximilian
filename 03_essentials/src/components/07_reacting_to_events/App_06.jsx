// Your goal is to change the email, password and loggedIn values when the button in the App_Props component is pressed
// Change them to any values of your choice (except loggedIn => that should be changed to true)
// You DON'T need to fetch the values entered into the <input /> fields
// You'll learn about that later in the course - for the moment, those fields are just there to look good :-)

// This exercise is just about practicing event handling
